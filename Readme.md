# Sample Bottle Application for Azure

This repository contains a sample [bottle][] application for Azure
Websites. The code was generated by choosing the Bottle in the Azure
Marketplace as described in this [Azure documentation page][] (generated on
2015-06-24).

There was one problem with the original code: static files were not served on
Azure, only on the development server, everything is fine. I suspect a problem
with web.config (in my case for 2.7). However, I could not figure out the
problem. We moved the static file handler in bottle to `route.py`.

## Usage

See [Azure documentation page][] for details on how to run the development
server and publish the site to Azure.
