# Sample Bottle Application for Azure

This repository contains a sample [bottle][] application for Azure
Websites. The code was generated by choosing the Bottle in the Azure
Marketplace as described in this [Azure documentation page][] (generated on
2015-06-24).

There was one problem with the original code: static files were not served on
Azure, only on the development server, everything is fine. I suspect a problem
with web.config (in my case for 2.7). However, I could not figure out the
problem. We moved the static file handler in bottle to `route.py`.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Create a "Web App" on [Azure Portal][]. Wait until the app is created.
3. Click on the created app and click on the tile "Deployment". Then "Choose Source" -> "Github". Authorize Azure to access your GitHub account.
4. Choose the repository. Wait until the initial version is deployed.

Now, as soon as you push a change to your GitHub repository, the change will be
deployed directly to the Azure site.
